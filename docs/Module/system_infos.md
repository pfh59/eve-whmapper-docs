### Third-Party Shortcuts

- **[Dotlan](https://evemaps.dotlan.net/)**: Offers detailed maps and data concerning regions, constellations, and systems in EVE Online.
- **[zKillboard](https://zkillboard.com/)**: Provides killboard statistics, recent kills, and losses within the selected system.
- **[Anoik.is](http://anoik.is/)**: Specializes in wormhole information, including effects and statics.

These resources are invaluable for players needing to analyze situations or plan routes efficiently.
